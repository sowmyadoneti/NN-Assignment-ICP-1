Program-1 // – Input the string “Python” as a list of characters from console, delete at least 2 characters, reverse the resultant string and print it.
Here in this program first the user has to enter the string as an input. All the letters will be then converted into list of characters.Now we are going to generate a random number to know the number of indexes that we are going to delete from the string. then we are runinmg a for loop to generate the number of indexes till we reach the random index number in each iteration and deleting the corresponding character for the index generating. Finally we are reversing the resultant string and printing it as an output.//  

Program-2 // - Write a program that accepts a sentence and replace each occurrence of ‘python’ with ‘pythons’ User has to enter a sentence which is in string format.lower function is used to convert all the upper case letters into lowercase letters.now the replace function is used inoder to replace each occurence of "python" with "pythons" 

Programe- 3 // - Use the if statement conditions to write a program to print the letter grade based on an input class score. Use the grading scheme we are using in this class. 
First we have to input a score and then we need to calculate the percentage of the score.Now using if and elif blocks perncentage is classified into the respective grades.Finally the corrospondent grade is printed. Grades are classidied as shown below 90%-100% is graded as A 80%-89% is graded as B 70%-79% is graded as C 60%-69% is graded as D Below 60%5 is garded as F.
